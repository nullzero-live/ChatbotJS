Using React, Node, MongoDB etc to make an AI Chatbot with the GPT3.5 API. 🙏 🙌

24/10/23 Added Cypress Library for E2E and component testing.
I'd like to get familiar with the front end testing capabilities for reasons other than this project.
Given my front end development skills and familiarity are low, it's a perfect chance to dive into the
fundamentals of web components and how to use them when structuring tests.

To Do:
[ ]:  Continue the Front End development component to get more functionality.
[ ]:  Review Cypress best practices.
[ ]:  Write some initial high level feature files in Gherkin for the core tests.
